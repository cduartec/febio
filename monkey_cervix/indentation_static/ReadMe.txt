To generate the model with different Sphere size, we could change the parameter "Sp_radius" in the file "NodeElement.m". 
To generate the model with different size (length, thickness, and width), the parameters "longwidth" "thickness" and "width" are in "main.m". 
The indentation depth could be found in "main.m" as "Indentationdispt". 
Everything could be generated automatically, including the mesh and other information to capture the indentation of the sample with thickness=40 mm. 
The final file generated is "testing_1.feb" . The results are shown in "testing_1.log" and "testing_1.xplt"
